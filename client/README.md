# WebRTC client

A simple WebRTC client written in React. It connects to the [Janus Node driver](../janus-node-driver) via WebSocket to broadcast its availability, and to exchange video streams. It receives back a video stream from the [Janus server](../janus/), which is then displayed on the screen.

## 🏃 How to run

To run the client, you can follow the steps below:

- Run the [Janus server](../janus/) and the [Janus Node driver](../janus-node-driver/) first
- `npm install`
- `npm start`. This will start the client on http://localhost:3000
- Open a browser tabs and go to http://localhost:3000
- Click the `Connect` and after less than a second you should see two video streams. The one on the left is the one you're sending, the one on the right is the one you're receiving.

## 🧑‍💻 Code

All the interesting code is in [the App.js file](src/App.js). The rest of the files are just boilerplate code generated by *Create React App*.
